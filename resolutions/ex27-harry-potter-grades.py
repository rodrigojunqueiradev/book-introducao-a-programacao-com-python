"""
27. You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores. 
Write a program that converts their scores to grades.

student_scores = {
    'Harry': 88,
    'Ron': 78,
    'Hermione': 95,
    'Draco': 75,
    'Neville': 60
}

By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names as keys and their assessed grades for values. 
The grade is: 
Score greater than or equal to 91 -> Outstanding;
Score greater than or equal to 81 -> Exceeds Expectations;
Score greater than or equal to 71 -> Acceptable;
Score less than or equal to 70 -> Fail.
